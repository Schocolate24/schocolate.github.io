    <h1>Intro to The SGI and Nichiren Buddhism</h1>
    <h2>What is SGI?</h2>
    <p class="sgi">SGI stands for Soka Gakkai International which is a buddhist organization of Nichiren Buddhism with 12 million practitioners
        in 192 countries and territories based on the practice of chanting Nam-Myoho-Rengekyo.
        We practice this Buddhism to enable each person to become happy and ultimately, to establish peace in the entire world.

        <h3>What do we do in this practice?</h3>
        <p>We chant daimoku,"Nam-Myoho-Rengekyo", and recite the sutra every morning and evening to "Gohonzon" which is 
            an object of when you chant daimoku.
            Every once a month, we have district meetings and a general meeting every weekend. 
            We used to do it in person but now we do every meetings on Zoom for this challenging time.

        <h3>The history of the SGI</h3>
        <p> The first president of the Soka Gakkai, Tunesaburo Makiguch, who was an
            educator for elementary school students, published a book called "The system of the value-creating education"
            on November 18, 1930, when he was 59.

        <h3>Nam-Myoho-Rengekyo</h3>
        <p>We chant "Nam-myoho-Rengekyo", which is the rythm of the universe, as a practice of this Buddhism.
           "Nam" means respectation, "Myo" means revitalization, "Ho" means the Mystic law, "Renge"
           means lotus, and finally, "Kyo" means the sutra.
